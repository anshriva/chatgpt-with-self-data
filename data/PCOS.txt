PCOS Santulan is carefully crafted to help alleviate symptoms associated with PCOS, including irregular cycles, hormonal imbalance, stress, and skin and hair-related issues. It also promotes overall healing and well-being by balancing doshas in the body.

Helps to manage irregular menstrual cycles (periods):
Irregular periods are a common symptom of PCOS. The blend of ingredients in PCOS Santulan is designed to support the female reproductive system and address menstrual disorders. (Refer below for details)


Helps to normalize hormonal balance:
PCOS disrupts female hormone levels by causing an excess of male hormones, leading to increased levels of DHT and potential hair loss. PCOS Santulan works to normalize hormone levels in the body.

Helps to reduce PCOS induced acne and hairfall:
Acne and hair fall are prevalent symptoms among individuals with PCOS. PCOS Santulan may address the underlying causes contributing to these symptoms.

Helps reducing pain:
In addition to addressing acne and irregular periods, PCOS Santulan also targets common symptoms like pelvic pain or menstrual cramps associated with PCOS. The ingredients in PCOS Santulan possess anti-spasmodic properties, offering relief from pain and discomfort.
